## ✅ Then What?

1. Click the **Console** tab
2. Start recording or use Coach features
3. Watch for messages like:
   - `"Live transcription started"`
   - `"Auto-detect: Found 2 questions"`
   - `"Coach voice recognition error: service-not-allowed"`

---

## 🎤 Voice Features Require

- ✅ **Chrome, Edge, or Safari** (NOT Firefox)
- ✅ **Microphone permission allowed** (you'll get a prompt)
- ✅ **Running on localhost** (http://127.0.0.1:8000)
- ✅ **Recording running** (before opening Coach)

## 🚨 "service-not-allowed" Error?

This means the browser is denying microphone access. Fix:

1. **Refresh the page** (Cmd+R or Ctrl+R)
2. **When prompted**, click **Allow** for microphone
3. Try Coach again

If you don't see a prompt, the browser already denied it:
1. **Chrome/Edge**: Click the 🔒 lock in address bar → Microphone → **Allow**
2. **Safari**: System Preferences → Security & Privacy → Microphone → add your browser

---

## 📝 Still Not Working?

1. Open Console (Cmd+Option+I on Mac)
2. Try the feature again
3. Look for error messages
4. Share the exact error with full details
